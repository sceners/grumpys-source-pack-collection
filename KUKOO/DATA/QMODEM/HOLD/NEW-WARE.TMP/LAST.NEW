pfiouuuu........

Here it is the unbugged version......

The "Flying" bug has been removed..... ( On some PC, specially without Sound
Card, the EXIT Screen was looping during 1750 frames !!!!! it was a problem
of pushing combined with a Adlib player bug....)

I've included the right files.....(sinus2.rol becomes sinus.rol)

Hope it will work on all PC this time....

See Ya
