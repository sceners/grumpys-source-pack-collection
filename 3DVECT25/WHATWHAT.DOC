  What goes with What:

  A little angel told me to summarize what files go with what....
  eg: if you change anything in the math.inc file, re-assemble 3d?.asm
      if you change anything in the stuff.inc file, re-assemble main?.asm

  3d1.asm
    vars1.inc
    math.inc
    xscale.inc
    sin.inc
    arctan.inc
    poly.inc
    squares.inc

  3d2.asm
    vars2.inc
    math.inc
    xscale.inc
    sin.inc
    arctan.inc
    poly.inc
    squares.inc

  main1.asm
    sphere.inc
    gamecolr.inc
    objects.inc
    stuff.inc

  main2.asm
    sphere.inc
    gamecolr.inc
    objects.inc
    stuff.inc

  irq.asm
    no included files

  pmode.asm
    no included files

  xmode.asm
    no included files

  xmouse.asm
    no included files


  files for definition of externals:

  eg, if you want to call some routines in xmode, have include xmode.inc in
  your assembley file.

  3d.inc
  irq.inc
  pmode.inc
  xmode.inc
  xmouse.inc
