Font-changing is possible, but you seem to have just missed a lot of
font-changing routines on here...

Well, here are routines to detect a VGA and an EGA adapter...}

function EGAInstalled:boolean;assembler;asm
 mov ax,$1200; mov bx,$10; mov cx,$FFFF; int $10;
 inc cx; mov al,cl; or al,ch;
 end;
                                              
function vgaPresent:boolean;assembler;asm
 mov ah,$F; int $10; mov oldMode,al;  {save old Gr mode}
 mov ax,$1A00; int $10;    {check for VGA/MCGA}
 cmp al,$1A; jne @ERR;     {no VGA Bios}
 cmp bl,7; jb @ERR;        {is VGA or better?}
 cmp bl,$FF; jnz @OK;
@ERR: xor al,al; jmp @EXIT;
@OK: mov al,1;
@EXIT:
 end;
