Subj : Assembly Grafix Routines

I'm looking for any inline assembly routines for graphis handling.  I need
faster routines for line drawing, pixel plotting, animation, and any other
nifty stuff...  I have palette changing routines down... Put these in your
code for GREAT, FAST RGB Palette Changing... }

     Procedure ASetRGBPalette (Color,Red,Green,Blue: byte);
          Begin
               Port[$3C8]:=Color;
               Port[$3C9]:=Red;
               Port[$3C9]:=Green;
               Port[$3C9]:=Blue;
          end;

{     This procedure Changes palette colors about 400% faster than the
built-in routines.  Also, a problem with flicker may have been encountered
with Turbo's Putimage functions.  Call this procedure RIGHT BEFORE the
putimage is called... Viola... NO Flicker! }

     Procedure WaitScreen;
          Begin
               Repeat Until (Port[$3DA] and $08) = 0;
               Repeat Until (Port[$3DA] and $08) <> 0;
          end;
