X1, Y1, X2, Y2 are all integers.  Integer math is faster than Real (just
about anything is).  Sqr and Sqrt are not Integer functions.  Try for
fun...     }

Function Dist( X1, Y1, X2, Y2 : Integer ) : Real;
VAR XTemp, YTemp : INTEGER; {the allocation of these takes time.  If you
                             don't want that time taken, make them
                             global with care}
BEGIN
  XTemp := X1 - X2;
  YTemp := Y1 - Y2;
  Dist := Round( Sqrt( XTemp*XTemp + YTemp*YTemp ));
END;

If you have a math coprocessor or a 486dx, try using DOUBLE instead of
REAL, and make sure your compiler is set to compile for 287 (or 387).
