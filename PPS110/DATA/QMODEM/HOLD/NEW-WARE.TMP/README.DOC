                         ÄÄÄÄ Introduction ÄÄÄÄ

     This is true-to-life Protracker module playing source for playing
     Amiga modules on an IBM PC, using at least a 286, presumably 12 mhz
     and above.  I have spent around 160 hours working on PPS, 82 hours
     going into the commenting of it for your benefit.

     All of the Protracker module playing and loading source is included
     in this archive.  To top all of that off, a completely
     user-supported SuperProPlay Advanced is included in its basic
     stages, source code and all.

     To the best of my knowledge, this is the only Protracker module
     playing source code on the market.  Sure, other people have created
     some really good module players, like WOWII by Jan Ole Suhr and
     Promod by David L¢pez & Angel Trigo, but nothing is as good as
     actually being able to use modules in your own programs.

     Since the original release of SuperProPlay around two years ago, I
     have always included a message saying that I'd release the source
     code.  As of that time, there have been many people who have
     requested that source, and I've always put the matter off saying
     that I'd like to comment it first.

     Well, you are now holding the final product in your hands.  I have
     now thoroughly tested almost everything.  The source code works for
     me, and it should work for you.  If you have problems, see the
     address below.


                          ÄÄÄÄ Disclaimer ÄÄÄÄ

     As is too common in this day and age, I must include a "Notice of
     Disclaimer".  I take no responsibility for anything you do with
     this software or anything that is created with this software.  If
     it ruins your life, then that is just tough, and you'll have to
     grin and bear it.

                                                Joshua C. Jensen

     Please do not change and re-upload this file or the source code
     files.  Send any corrections to me and I will incorporate any
     corrections/changes/enhancements immediately.


                          ÄÄÄÄ Shareware ÄÄÄÄ


     I NEVER release programs as Shareware but always as Freeware.
     However, when I release source code with the program, the package
     becomes Shareware.  I do this because:  1) Hey, if you make
     millions of dollars from a piece of software that uses these
     routines, surely fifty dollars wouldn't be a bad investment for me
     to further support this software.  2) I don't believe in the
     commercial libraries that charge hundreds of dollars for the
     libraries and hundreds of dollars more for the source code.  3) I
     firmly believe in Shareware.  I register mine!  So should you.

     Basically, we'll say this.  If you use PPS in your software, you
     have three choices:  1) You can totally ignore the fact that I
     wrote it and include it in your software.  I won't do anything
     about it.  2) You can release source code with your product so
     people can use it to learn skills in programming.  3) You can send
     me some money (I treat this like a software package, $50 would be
     nice) for me to use for upgrades of this package.

     Obviously, if you choose choice 1, I won't be able to do anything
     about it.  How am I supposed to know if you used the Amiga
     Protracker source to write an IBM module player?  They would look
     the same!

     If you choose to register this software, you are entitled to the
     following:

               * Notifications of when new releases are
                 out, and depending on how much you pay,
                 free upgrade disks.

               * A guilt-free conscience.

               * Technical support.

     That would be about it.  PPS is not Crippleware; it includes
     everything that the registered version includes.  Any questions,
     money, bugs, suggestions, etc, can be sent to:

     Please, nobody call me collect if you happen to obtain my phone
     number.  I'm not rich, and I won't accept the call.


                    ÄÄÄÄ Now for the fun stuff! ÄÄÄÄ

     Now that all of the above is taken care of, let me explain what is
     going on.

     SuperProPlay Advanced and the Protracker Playing Source are written
     using Borland's TASM 2.01 and TLINK in IDEAL mode, all registered
     trademarks of Borland International, Inc.	If you don't have Ideal
     mode, then send me a letter.  I will convert it to MASM mode if there
     is popular enough of demand.  I didn't include the library files
     this time to save space in the archive.  If you'd like an assembled
     version and don't have an assembler, contact me.

     It shouldn't be too hard to convert the routines to work in another
     language.  I have personally used the player in C and Pascal
     programs by writing external procedures and setting up the
     appropriate registers in these procedures.  If there is demand for
     these routines to be written, I will include them in a future
     release.

     A manual is being prepared.  It will be professionally printed and
     available for people to buy.  This option comes to registered
     users.  A price is not set yet.  This manual will supply all module
     information, technical information, equations, etc., for the
     player.

     Last, but not least (or all that is coming to mind anyway), is
     SuperProPlay Advanced.  I decided to make this entirely user
     supported.  If you have a change or a new feature, include it in
     the source code and send the revised source back to me.  Don't
     re-upload it to BBSs!  I want to maintain some degree of order with
     this package.

     The SPP Advanced source shows how many of the features work.  I
     haven't written the instrument player in yet, but it should be
     there the next release.

     If the source code appears to look unformatted, there are lots of
     tab characters in it.  Make sure your tabs are set to 8.

     BTW, modules play in the background.  The TAB key switches
     between the file selection screen and playing screen.  The F7 and
     F8 keys go forward and backward in a module.  The Home key goes to
     the beginning of the current track, the END key, the end.  The
     F1 through F4 shut off the appropriate voice (F1 - Voice 1, etc.).
     The F9 and F10 keys should change the Master Volume, but it has a
     bug in it.

     Thanks to all of the people who have supported this so far and
     offered suggestions.

                                       Thanks,
                                       Joshua C. Jensen
