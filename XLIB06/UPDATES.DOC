26-09-92 - PRIMARILY JUST ADDED SUPPORT FOR PEL PANNING

	   Pel panning code added to allow for panning to any pixel
	   coordinates.
	   Functions affected:
	      x_set_splitscreen
		Split screen pel panning suppression code added.
		Functionally unchanged.
	      x_set_start_addr,x_page_flip
		Pel panning code added. The x parameter now expects
		a pixel coordinate where previously a byte coordinate
		was expected.

Xlib version 4b modifications

10-12-92   BUG FIX RELEASE

	   Files Modified
	   --------------

	   XMAIN.*
	   XPBMCLIP.*
	   XVBMCLIP.*
	   XCLIPPBM.*

	   Modifications/Additions
	   ------------------------
	   Some minor fixes and modifications in xmain.asm
	    fixed the split screen starting scan line problem

	    This fix is a cludge - Sam Thompson has suggested a more
	    elegant fix but I just dont have much time these days

	    changed mode setting code to allow 320x200 mode to have same
	     aspect ratio as mode 13h

	   The clipped functions were modified to return 1 if the image being
	    clipped was completely off the logical screen.
	   Minor clipping bugs which gave inconsistent results when clipping
	    to the left and right screen borders were fixed in the XPBMCLIP &
	    VBMCLIP modules.
	   A bug in demo 2 which caused crashing on 486 machines was also
	   fixed. (The speed of the 486 resulted in 0 time delay which inturn
	    caused a division by zero error)

28-12-92   Modified PEL panning code to be smoother on snail paced PC's
	   Added quick & dirty planar bitmap compiler


15-2-93    Converted text module to allow variable width user fonts

	   Added a function x_get_char_width in module xtext
	   Added fonts var6x8.fnt varswisl.fnt varswisb.fnt
	   Clened up virt screen start address setting code in xmain.asm

	   Added demo 8 to preview user defined fonts

	   Added x_wait_vsync in module xmain

	   Fixed a bug with mode sets on some VGA bios'es that dont
	   preserve CX on an int 10h

18-8-93    XLIB05 Final Release
	   -----------------------------------------------

	   GENERAL:
	     Added C++ compatability in header files
	     Added new fonts 
	   XDETECT: now can differentiate between 386sx 386dx and 486
	     (486sx can be verified by absence of FPU)
	   XMOUSE:
	     Fixed x_mouse_position bug and general xmouse improvements
	     Added x_mouse_window function
	   XFILEIO:
	     Modified f_read and f_write functions xfileio module
	     f_read    - now reads into near buffer reguardless of model
	     f_readfar    "    "    "   far    "         "      "    "
	     f_write      "  writes "   near   "         "      "    "
	     f_writefar   "    "    "   far    "         "      "    "
	     Added f_tell function to get file position. I beleive I
	     improved the error handling a little but I cant remember
	     for sure.
	   XMAIN:
	     Added 2 new resolutions 256x200 & 256x240.
	     I dont know why you'd want them but theyre there if you do.
	     These came from Draeden of VLA (Did you write them Ben ?)
	     I think they may have originally been posted on R.G.P ???
	   XRECT:
	     Added x_rect_fill_clipped & x_rect_pattern_clipped, probably
	     useless but what the heck!
	   XPOLYGON:
	     New function x_triangle - a fast clipped and filled trinagle
	      function ideal for 3D work.
	     x_polygon - a clipped and filled polygon function (convex
	       polygons only). This one's not the fastest - it splits
	       polygons into component triangles and uses the above
	       triangle routine to draw them, but still it should
	       perform fast enough for most 3D applications.
	   MISCELLANEOUS:
	      xdiscuss.zip: Included Robert Schmidt's excellent mode X article
		for those interested in the hows and why's of Mode X progamming
	      xlibtl02.zip: Some bitmap conversion code and a TSR bitmap
		capture program.


	   Aknowledgements
	   ---------------
	   Gerald Dalley         - For getting me off my butt and doing
				   this release.

	   Steve Dollins         - Never returned my mail asking for
				   permission to use his code so I
				   assumed it'd be OK ;)

	   Christian Harms       - For suggesting xdetect improvements and
				   promising to make XLIB for T.P. freeware
				   when its complete. good on ya mate!

	   Jason Truong          - For spotting the bug in xmouse and
				   general suggestions for improvements

	   Chris Kirby           - For suggestion to make .h files C++
				   compliant

	   Robert Scmidt         - For his mode X article.

	   jeremi@ee.ualberta.ca - Thanks for the xtext suggestions
	   (name unknown)          even if they didnt make this release

	   And others whom I may have forgotten.

	   Also Greetings to my internet pals,
	     Mat Mackenzie, Jari Karjala, Draeden, Victor Putz,
	     Josh Jensen, Chicken and the rest of you dudes...
	     Thanks for helping my productivity live up to
	     "Public Servant" standards ;-))

5-10-93
	   -----------------------------------------------
	   XCBITM32:
	     32 bit compiled bitmaps, originally developed by Matthew
	     Mackenzie for our game. NOTE: The compiler is written in C -
	     conversion to assembler is left as an excersise for the user :-)
	   
	   XMOUSE: Finished x_mouse_window this time. I had overlooked
	      its semi-completed x_mouse_window function in the last release.

	   XPBITMAP:
	      Added x_flip_pbm and x_flip_masked_pbm
	      Identical to x_put_pbm and x_put_masked_pbm but have an
	      extra parameter which indicates whether the bitmap is flipped
	      from left to right as drawn or not - Ideal for saving bitmap
	      memory.

	    XFILL:
	      Added a new module containing 2 flood fill variants. Both return
	      the number of pixels filled.

	    XVSYNC:
	      New module to synchronise timer 0 to the vertical retrace. This
	      allows for smoother animation due to the elimination of
	      unnecessary vsync waiting.

	    XMAIN:
	      Modifications to allow standard vsync polling or optional
	      timer0/vsync synchronization and new support for tripple
	      buffering for super-smooth animation. This stuff's way cool!

	    BUGS:
	      fixed the odd bug here and there - nothing too serious.


	    Aknowledgements:

	    Tiaan A Geldenhuys - for pointing out that I forgot to finish
	     some code in xmouse.asm, for the new cursor shape and stuff.

	    Thanks to Tore Jahn Bastiansen (toreba@ifi.uio.no) for the
	    tripple buffering extensions to XMAIN and the excellent
	    Timer vsync sunchronization which is the highlight of this
	    release. This module is a "MUST HAVE" if youre going to do
	    any animation.

	    Also thanks to any others, whom I may have lost track of,
	    for bug fixes'n stuff.

	    Apologies to the person who sent me the pbm flipping code.
