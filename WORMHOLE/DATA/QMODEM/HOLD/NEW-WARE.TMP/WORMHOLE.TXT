Files:
	PIC1.c, PIC2.c: are include files.  They are the picture in two gigantic
arrays.  (Translated from a Pascal screen capture program - otherwise I would
have made it one big one!)
	WORMHOL6.c produces the screen image that is "cycled" Imagine a
checkerboard as follows:

		1  2  3  4
		5  6  7  8
		9  10 11 12
		13 14 15 16

What happens is that whatever colors are in positions 1,5,9,&13 are stored.
2-4,6-8,10-12,14-16 are shifted over, then 1,5,9,&13 are put on the right.
The new thing would look like this:
		2  3  4  1
		6  7  8  5
		10 11 12 9
		14 15 16 13
Then it's shifted down:
		6  7  8  5
		10 11 12 9
		14 15 16 13
		2  3  4  1
if you repeat this it looks like a moving checkerboard.  Change that into a 3d
picture where colors are placed appropriately, and you have a wormhole.
	
	WORMIT3.c does the cycling.  It's not really cycling though.  The 
transformations above are actually done in this program.  The color numbers
are not changed, simply the color positions in the palette.
	
	Anyway, you'll need Turbo C++ and TASM to run them - they use assembly
language plot routines a friend of mine wrote.  In places the code is absolutely
ugly, in such a way that no one else could understand it.  Hopefully you won't
have too many problems.
