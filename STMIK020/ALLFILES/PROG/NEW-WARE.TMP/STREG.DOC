The Shareware concept:
	Scream Tracker is distributed as shareware. This means
	that the unregistered evaluation version can be 
	distributed freely. With evaluation version you can
	test the product before making the decision.
	After 30 days of testing, you must decide whether you will
	or will not use the program. If you decide to use it,
	you are under both moral and legal obligation to register
	it with the author. If you decide not to use it, and 
	act according to this decision, you are under no obligation.
	The Scream Tracker is protected by international copyright
	laws, and the registered version must not be copied to
	any other than personal use.
		
What is gained by registering:
	After you have registered, you'll receive a registered
	version of Scream Tracker, which will contain functional
	Save routines and the Load Amiga Module function. 
	Registered users will also receive a printed Quick
	Reference Chart for commands. Also update discounts
	will apply to all registered users.
	
How to register:
	You should send me a letter including the registeration
	form (REGISTER.FRM) in printed or otherways copied form
	and fully filled and signed. If you send a check, you
	can include it in your letter. After I have received the
	letter and verified that the registeration fee has been 
	payed, I'll send the registered version. DO NOT send
	checks from outside Finland because changinc the check
	to money will cost a lot. Please transfer the money 
	directly to the account, or if it's impossible, send
	any western currency for the amount equal to 190FIM.
	
What does it cost:
	Registering will cost 190 FIM (approximately $48).
	
Payment methods:
	The registeration fee can be transferred to my account.
	If you live in Finland, the account is:
		Postipankki Turku, TU-651770-4
	Otherwise you can use international money transfer to:
		Postipankki, 00007 Helsinki 7, Finland
		SWIFT PSPB FI HH account TU-651770-4
	You can also send the payment in a letter (See end of this
	file for the address). If you use money transfer, please
	include a copy of the money transfer form. This will enable
	me to send your registered version faster. Avoid checks 
	outside Finland, use money transfer or cash instead.

Receiving the registered version:
	  I will send the Scream Tracker on a 1.2MB 5¬" diskette,
	unless you have only a 3«" drive. The posting expences
	are included when the Scream Tracker is sent normally
	by mail. If you request some special sending method,
	you must pay the extra cost.
